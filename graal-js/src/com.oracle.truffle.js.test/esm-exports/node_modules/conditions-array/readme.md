In Node.js, when `"exports"` is an **array**, Node will try each entry **in
order** and use the **first one that successfully resolves**.

In the example:

```json
".": [
  {
    "import": "./dist/walk.mjs",
    "require": "./dist/walk.js"
  },
  "./dist/walk.js"
]
```

* Node first evaluates the object `{ "import": ..., "require": ... }`:

  * If the consumer does `import`, it tries `"import"`.
  * If the consumer does `require()`, it tries `"require"`.

* If that object **cannot be resolved** for some reason (e.g., environment
  doesn’t match any condition, file is missing), Node moves on to the **next
  array entry** (`"./dist/walk.js"`).

The last item acts as a **fallback** if the earlier conditional object fails.

In modern Node with properly configured files, this fallback is usually
redundant because each condition (`import`/`require`) would normally resolve.
The array pattern mostly exists for **robustness or backward compatibility**.
