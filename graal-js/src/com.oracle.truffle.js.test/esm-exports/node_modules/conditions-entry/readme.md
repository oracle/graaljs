In this example, the `"exports"` field is defining **entry points for the
package** based on runtime conditions:

```json
"exports": {
  "graal": {
    "import": "./graal.mjs",
    "require": "./graal.cjs"
  },
  "node": {
    "import": "./node.mjs",
    "require": "./node.cjs"
  }
}
```

* `"graal"` and `"node"` are **condition keys**, not subpaths.
* Node (or a supporting loader) selects the first condition that matches the
  environment.
* Inside each condition, `"import"` and `"require"` define the **module system
  entry point**.

So this configuration:

* Is **only for the package root entry**, i.e., `import 'package'` or
  `require('package')`.
* Does **not define subpaths** like `"./something.js"`; it only tells Node which
  file to load depending on the runtime or module system.

If you wanted subpaths, each condition could contain objects with `"."` or
`"./sub.js"` keys instead.
